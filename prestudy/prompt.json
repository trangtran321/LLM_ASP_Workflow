        "context": "Entity Types 1. Task: \n Definition: Applications, problems to solve, systems to construct. \n Examples: information extraction, machine reading system, image segmentation, etc. \n 2. Method: \n Definition: Methods , models, systems to use, or tools, components of a system, frameworks. \n Examples: language model, CORENLP, POS parser, kernel method, etc. \n 3. Evaluation Metric: \n Definition: Metrics, measures, or entities that can express quality of a system/method. \n Examples: F1, BLEU, Precision, Recall, ROC curve, mean reciprocal rank, mean-squared error, robustness, time complexity, etc. \n 4. Material: \n Definition: Data, datasets, resources, Corpus, Knowledge base. Example: image data, speech data, stereo images, bilingual dictionary, paraphrased questions, CoNLL, Panntreebank, WordNet, Wikipedia, etc. \n 5. Other Scientiﬁc Terms: \n Definition: Phrases that are a scientiﬁc terms but do not fall into any of the above classes Example: physical or geometric constraints, qualitative prior knowledge, discourse structure, syntactic rule, discourse structure, tree, node, tree kernel, features, noise, criteria \n 6. Generic: \n Definition: General terms or pronouns that may refer to a entity but are not themselves informative, often used as connection words. Example: model, approach, prior knowledge, them, it... \n 1.2 Relationship Types \n Relationships cannot go beyond a sentence boundary. \n - USED-FOR: \n Definition: B is used for A, B models A, A is trained on B, B exploits A, A is based on B. \n Examples: 1. The TISPER system has been designed to enable many text applications. 2. Our method models user proﬁciency. 3. Our algorithms exploits local soothness. \n - FEATURE-OF: \n Definition: B belongs to A, B is a feature of A, B is under A domain. \n Examples: 1. prior knowledge of the model 2. genre-speciﬁc regularities of discourse structure 3. English text in science domain \n - HYPONYM-OF: \n Definition: B is a hyponym of A, B is a type of A. \n Examples: 1. TUIT is a software library 2. NLP applications such as machine translation and language generation \n - PART-OF: \n Definition: B is a part of A... \n Examples: 1. The system includes two models: speech recognition and natural language understanding 2. We incorporate NLU module to the system. \n - COMPARE: \n Definition: Symmetric relation. Opposite of conjunction, compare two models/methods, or listing two opposing entities. \n Examples: 1. Unlike the quantitative prior, the qualitative prior is often ignored... 2. We compare our system with previous sequential tagging systems... \n - CONJUNCTION: \n Definition: Symmetric relation. Function as similar role or use/incorporate with. \n Examples: 1. obtained from human expert or knowledge base 2. NLP applications such as machine translation and language generation \n There are three additional constraints you must follow: \n 1. Do not label negative relations. For example: X is not used in Y or X is hard to be applied in Y \n 2. Do not tag relation if one entity is: a. Variable bound. For example: \"We introduce a neural based approach.. Its beneﬁt is...\" b. The word 'which'. For example: \"We introduce a neural based approach, which is a...\" \n 3. Do not include determinators (such as the, a), or adjective pronouns (such as this,its, these, such) to the span. If generic phrases are not involved in a relation, do not tag them.",

The problem is formulated in a manner that subsumes structure from motion , multi-view stereo , and photo-metric stereo as special cases . The algorithm utilizes both spatial and temporal intensity variation as cues : the former constrains flow and the latter constrains surface orientation ; combining both cues enables dense reconstruction of both textured and texture-less surfaces . The algorithm works by iteratively estimating affine camera parameters , illumination , shape , and albedo in an alternating fashion . Results are demonstrated on videos of hand-held objects moving in front of a fixed light and camera .“ \n Output: {“entities“: [{“original_entity“: “algorithm“,  “original_type“: “Generic“,
