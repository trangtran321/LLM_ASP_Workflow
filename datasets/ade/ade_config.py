CONTEXT = "1. Entities can be of type 'drug' or 'adverse-effect'. Below, each entity type's definition is expanded on and clarifies when an entity belongs to that type.\n1.1 Drug\nNames of drugs and chemicals that include brand names, trivial names, abbreviations and systematic names were annotated. Mentions of drugs or chemicals should strictly be in a therapeutic context.\nThis category does not include the names of metabolites, reaction byproducts, or hospital chemicals (e.g. surgical equipment disinfectants).\n1.2 Adverse-effect\nMentions of adverse effects include signs, symptoms, diseases, disorders, acquired abnormalities, deficiencies, organ damage or death that strictly occur as a consequence of drug intake\n2. Relationships can be of only one type: 'adverse effect'. The scope of a relationship was defined and restricted to the sentence level. There should be a clear mention of a drug/chemical resulting in an adverse effect defined within the context of a sentence.\nMentions of drugs, disorders or dosages that do not fit into a relation were not annotated. Relationships were annotated between the drugs and adverse effects as well as between the drugs.",
